# wififix
A solution to fix the Wifi in Penn Manor High School.

## Descrition
This allows the computer to fix wifi issues every time the wifi stops working.
It will repeatedly check the wifi, and it will reset the wifi every time it detects a weak wifi signal.

## Initial Stage
The project is still in the working alpha stage. This means the software may still have issues, and these issues will be fixed in future updates.
